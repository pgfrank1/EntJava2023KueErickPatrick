# Indoor Plants API

### Team Members: Patrick Frank, Erick Reyes, Kue Xiong

### Problem Statement

There are many kinds of indoor plants and each may require a 
different level of care. It can be difficult to remember the 
details of each plant. The Indoor Plants API allow access to 
the plant type, plant name, care level, and amount of light. 
The information will be retrieved from a database.

We've been looking at a few databases to pull our information from: \
https://docs.trefle.io/reference/ \
https://rapidapi.com/search/Plant \
This is the USDA Documentation for their data retrieval:\

However, there seems to be limited documentation on the USDA api.
