# Team Resume
## Kue Xiong, Erick, Patrick Frank

### Is a good speaker?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I'm a decent speaker. I occasionally loose my train of thought
    but if I have a script or some notes I can get back on track.
### Is a good listener?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I think that I'm a very good listener. I usually like to 
    listen to others talk about themselves compared to talking about myself.
### Can manage details?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I'm think I could have some improvement with remembering details.
    But, if I have everything written down I can remember and
    even improve on the details.
#### Kue Xiong
    Yes.
### Is creative?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I think I'm creative in the way of coming up with solutions for a problem.
    Especially problems with technology.
#### Kue Xiong
    I concur. I am creative in problem solving. Not so much artistic creativity
### Likes competition?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I like competition if it is something that I'm good at. I try to
    do my best either way but I try to be the winner if I can.
### Likes to lead?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I usually like to lead depending on those that I'm working with. I
    love to get everyone's input before making a decision and making
    sure that everyone is on the same page.
#### Kue Xiong
    I usually don't offer to lead but I do like to keep meetings moving along, 
    so I tend to interject more than I should. I am working on restraining myself.
### Likes to follow/follow directions?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I have no issue with following directions until there's something 
    that I think can be improved upon and the leader doesn't allow it. I
    always am looking for ways to improve processes and implement them
#### Kue Xiong
### Thinks fast on their feet?\

    I'm very good and improvising when it is needed.
#### Kue Xiong
    My patients can be unpredictable.
### Makes decisions quickly?\
#### Patrick Frank
    I'm not the best at quick decisions. I like to get everyone's input
    before making one so I know that I chose the best decision
    based off of input other than my own
#### Kue Xiong
    When it's work related and the decisions affect more than just me, I like to
    get feedback before implementing it.

#### Patrick Frank
    I'm not the best at creating slides. I feel that mine are a bit too
